\section{Introduction} \label{section: introduction}
JavaCraft is a a multifaceted text-based Java game inspired by Minecraft. The game is a relatively complex Java program that brings over 35 functions to create a diverse gameplay experience. This team project is an academic exercise in computer science, logical thinking, and collaboration. Working in teams of four, we used our creativity, analytical skills, and technical skills to analyse and expand upon the existing JavaCraft game. The source code of JavaCraft can be found in the following link: \url{https://gitlab.maastrichtuniversity.nl/bcs1110/javacraft/-/raw/main/JavaCraft.java} \\

Below is a table that describes what each team member did on the project, divided by section:
