\section{Git Collaboration \& Version Control} \label{section: git}
The link to the JavaCraft branch can be found here: \href{https://gitlab.maastrichtuniversity.nl/bcs1110/javacraft/-/tree/group11}{https://gitlab.maastrichtuniversity.nl/bcs1110/javacraft/-/tree/group11} \\

All the files of the project can be found in the repository. \\ 
Everything was done on one branch called group11. There were no conflicts during the process due to the way we divided the tasks. Each section of the report is done at most by two different people, with the exception of the 15 flowcharts with pseudocode. \\
For the 15 flowcharts with pseudocode, we created two folders in the git branch: one for flowcharts and one for pseudocode. The folder contains one file for each function, meaning that in total we have 15 (or more) files per folder. Having everything separated in folders makes it easy to add the files to this document and to also keep track of each other's progress.
