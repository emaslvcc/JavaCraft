PSEUDOCODE  void generateWorld()


Initialising variables
	random variable called rand

For loops:
	
	start y at 0 iterate through all the lines of worldheight ( iterating through all y coordinates of the world)
		start x at 0 and iterate through all the lines of worldWidth ( iterating through all x coordinates of the world )
			
			make sure randValue ( based on the random variable initiated before ) is between 0 and 100

			check if randValue is less than 20
				if it is set the block WOOD to that x and y ( coordinate )
			else check if randValue is less than 35
				if it is, set the block LEAVES to that x and y (coordinate)
			else check if randValue is less than 50
				if it is, set the block STONE to that x and y (coordinate)
			else check if randValue is less than 70
				if it is, set the block IRON_ORE to that x and y (coordinate)
		else 
			set the block AIR to that x and y (coordinate) 

since the method is type void, it will not return anything.
