pseudocode 




generateEmptyWorld function 


initialize a 2D array called world with new_world_height and new_world_width as dimensions 
initiate red block = 1
initiate white block = 4
initiate blue block = 3
initiate stripheight = new_world_height array divided by 3 


fill first strip with red blocks via a for loop
        for y from 0 to stripheight -1, y  increases each time by 1
                for loop with x from 0 to new_world_width; increases each time by 1 
define x and y as the values of the array world and place a red block for each y and x


fill second strip with white color via a for loop
        for y from stripheight to (stripheight *2) -1, y  increases each time by 1
                for loop with x from 0 to new_world_width; increases each time by 1 
define x and y as the values of the array world and place a white block for each y and x 
        
fill the third strip of the flag with blue blocks 
        for y from (stripheight *2) to (stripheight *3) -1, y  increases each time by 1
                for loop with x from 0 to new_world_width; increases each time by 1 
define x and y as the values of the array world and place a blue block for each y and x
