Take input from player and save it in string direction
START
    In case of:
        direction in uppercase = "W" or "UP"
            If player's Y coordinate is greater than 0, then: 
                decrease player's Y coordinate by 1
        direction in uppercase = "S" or "DOWN"
            If player's Y coordinate is smaller than worldHeight-1, then: 
                increase player's Y coordinate by 1
        direction in uppercase = "A" or "LEFT"
            If player's X coordinate is greater than 0, then: 
                decrease player's X coordinate by 1
        direction in uppercase = "D" or "RIGHT"
            If player's X coordinate is smaller than worldWidth-1, then: 
                increase player's X coordinate by 1
