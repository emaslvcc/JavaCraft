Episode I: The Git Push

It is a period of code wars. Student developers, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Syntax Errors.

During the battle, student devs managed to push their names to this `readme.txt` file, an important step towards ultimate mastery of the Force of Git.

Join the Rebellion! Add your name to this list and push it back to the repository:
