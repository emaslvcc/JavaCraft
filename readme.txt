In a repository far, far away...

Episode I: The Git Push

It is a period of code wars. Student developers, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Syntax Errors.

During the battle, student devs managed to push their names to this `readme.txt` file, an important step towards ultimate mastery of the Force of Git.

Join the Dark side! Add your name to this list and push it back to the repository:

1. Matteo Cannata
2. Sofia Mihova
3. Rares Huci
4. Efe Berk YÄ±lmaz 
5. Karlis Pukis


Beware the Dark Side of git - conflicts are everywhere.

May the Source be with you!
