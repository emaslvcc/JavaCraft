This function describes an algorithm used to frame the game world and populate its content with characters.
function displayWorld():
    Print "World Map:"
    Print "╔══" + "═".repeat(worldWidth * 2 - 2) + "╗" //It shapes the upper boundaries of the map.
    for each row y in worldHeight:
        Print "║"
        for each column x in worldWidth:
            if (x equals playerX and y equals playerY and not inSecretArea):
                Print "P "
            else if (x equals playerX and y equals playerY and inSecretArea):
                Print "P "
            else:
                Print getBlockSymbol(world[x][y]) // Utilize the getBlockChar function and assign its values to the variables x and y, then proceed to print these values.
        Print "║"
    Print "╚══" + "═".repeat(worldWidth * 2 - 2) + "╝"//It shapes the bottom boundaries of the map.
